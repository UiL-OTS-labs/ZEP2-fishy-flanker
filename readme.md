# ZEP2-fishy-flanker

This folder holds 2 similar but different flanker tasks. In the
young folder is an experiment for small children and in the old folder is
an experiment for older children.

## The flanker task

The target is flanked by distracting stimuli which correspond either to the same
directional response as the target (congruent flankers), to the opposite
response (incongruent flankers), or to neither (neutral flankers).
The test can be used to assess the ability to suppress responses that are
inappropriate in a particular context.

The task is response contingent, that is the target + flankers are displayed
until the participant responses. After the response the new target is displayed
according the Response Stimulus Interval (RSI) in the table with test items.
In the current example trials with different RSI values exist, 200, 500 and 700
ms respectively.

Randomization is according to these rules:

* No rules, they are pseudo randomized with no constraints on item order.
